The first question asked what specific text the title should display, offering two options: \"A creative title that reflects the app's purpose\" and \"A simple and straightforward title.\" The second question inquired about preferences for the title's font style or size, again providing two choices: \"I want it to be bold and large\" or \"I prefer a sleek and modern font.\" The AI noted the input and output token counts and the time taken for processing, ensuring a clear understanding of the user's requests and preferences.\nUser: add a nice title\nAI: Okay, I'll add a nice title for you.\nAI: Sure, I\u2019ll add a title for you.\nUser: add a title\n\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made:\nadd me a nice subtitle"
