The user was then asked questions about their preferences, offering two options for each: for the title wording, they could choose between \"A catchy and creative title\" or \"A straightforward and descriptive title,\" and for the title's position, the options were \"At the top of the screen\" or \"Centered in the main content area.\" Later, the AI reiterated its commitment to adding an appealing title, acknowledging a request for \"a nice title\" by confirming, \"Sure, I'll add an appealing title for you.\"\nUser: add a nice copy\nUser: add me a nice subtitle\nAI: Sure, I'll add a nice subtitle for you.\nUser: add a nice title\nAI: Okay, I'll add a nice title for you.\n\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made:\nadd a nice copy"
